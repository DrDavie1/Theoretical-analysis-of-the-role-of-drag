---------THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF DRAG---------


    -----PROJECT OVERVIEW----

    This is a personal project. It's quite magical what mathematics can create, combined with a little colour theory the results are rather beautiful. I became a bit obsessed with this style of art. I have included my 3 favourite projects of this nature.

    Libraries Used:

        - Pillow (PIL)
        - random
        - numpy
        - math
        - colorsys
        - os

    Skills shown: Understanding of Co-ordinate systems, Mathematical Functions and Data manipulation. 

    -----Running Information----

    The format of each folder is identical.

    Simply run the main.py file in each folder. View the results in the Images folder.

    To generate more images, alter the values in the for loop. It is located at the bottom of every main.py file.
